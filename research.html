        <h2>Protection and functionality</h2>
        <p>
            Our research seems to indicate that masks are a measure one takes to protect others rather than to protect
            themselves. They are effective in slowing virus spread only when paired with frequent hand washing. Wearing
            a mask does not necessarily guarantee protection against infection.

        <h2>Types of masks</h2>
        <p>
            There are different types of masks on the market. Ones that are used in the hospitals and for medical use
            and some that can be used for living. It is very important that the mask has a good filtration system and it
            hold small microns out (or in).
        </p>
        <p>
            The following is an overview of the filtration effectiveness of different frequently used masks with the
            standards of different continents:

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <p>
            The use of cotton in an outer layer of a mouth mask can be very beneficial. The material can be washed at a
            very high temperature to kill bacteria. Cotton can also hold 24-27 times their own weight. For a mouth mask
            this is a huge advantage with the moisture that comes out of your mouth while breathing.

        <h2>Quilting</h2>
        <p>
            Quilting is a technique which can be used with cotton fabric and is also a good solution. Quilters have a
            high quality and a high thread count cotton. It shows that these filters are just as good or better than the
            surgical mask in the hospital with a percentage of 70 to 79 filtration. The disadvantage of quilting is that
            it is not easy to do for an unexperienced sewer.

        <h2>Filter</h2>
        <p>
            The standards of the vacuum cleaner bags are estimated to remove 99,97 percent of the particles that are 0.3
            microns in size from the air that passes through them. Particles smaller than 0.3 microns can escape from
            the filter. This is the best filter with the most hold of the particles that can be made from household
            materials. What people need to be attentive to that they use the vacuum cleaner bags without glass fibers.
            These can be harmful for your health.

        <h2> Washing</h2>
        <p>
            The washing of the homemade mask is a complex piece. To get more knowledge of this we asked the Robert Koch
            Institute for help. The information we got from them is to wash the masks in the machine at 95 degrees for
            30 minutes then the virus will be killed. With washing it is very important to be careful what the mask is
            touching, when it gets in touch with different objects this can be infected.

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
            Non-woven fabrics have the best properties for a mouth mask, the disadvantage to this is that non-woven
            fabrics are not a regular fabric that people have at home. After the research, the recommended material to
            use for a mouth mask is a hydrophilic material as outer material and a hydrophobic material as a filter. For
            our research it is important that people can easily make a mask themselves with household materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our
            recommendation for the outer material is to use a cellulose fiber material like cotton and for filter
            material a vacuum cleaner bag. This will give a good filtration if the mask fits correctly to the face.
            Therefore, different sizes of patterns are available in our research.
